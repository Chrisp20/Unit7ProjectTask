# Project 7 - The TASK Master App

Submitted by: Christopher Petit

The TASK Master app, is an app that as part of the IOS devs course, I was tasked to use user defaults 
in order to smoothly run a list of task and translate them into a calendar. This can do all sorts of things.
For example, add tasks to a list, that will prompt users to give a title, description, and a due date. Messed up?
No worries, you can go back and correct any errors whether it is a date channge or an overall plan change.
The task master app also has built in connection to a calendar that will allow users to keep track of the tasks
on a very versatile and synched in calendar making life even more great.


Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays a list of tasks
- [X] Users can add tasks to the list

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-The challenge I faced while building the app was the presence of duplicate
task being created whenever I would press the complete/incomplete circle. I
was able to fix this issue by editing variables that were originally type let
to type var, allowing me to move onto the next portion of the code.
